// Adaptation of Elegoo TFTLCD code adapted from Adafruit TFTLCD code
// specifically for "ELEGOO UNO R3 2.8 Inches TFT Touch Screen with SD Card Socket w/All Technical Data in CD for Arduino UNO R3"
// operating as a shield on top of ELEGOO UNO R3 Board (Arduino compatible)

// to extend example touch/paint app for my daughter
// and to see if drag and drop was possible
// requires install of Elegoo libraries https://www.elegoo.com/pages/arduino-kits-support-files

//implements multiple menus for additional color sections

//implements a third menu of basic brush and basic shapes

//implements drag and drop for basic shapes
//corrects (?) for numerous issues that should have prevented this

//derives from class TouchScreen to implement multiple returns for getPoint to enable drag and drop

//maybe soon I will separate out the drag and drop from the paint portion
